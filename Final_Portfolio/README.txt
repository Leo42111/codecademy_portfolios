Final Portfolio

This project is an investigation of Amazon's Top 50 bestselling books from 2009 to 2019. We will use NumPy and Pandas to load and analyze the database, and use Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize the data. We will also use Scikit-learn to solve a machine learning classification model.

The following points will be investigated and discussed in this project:
1. The trend of bestsellers genre over the years
2. Books that have become bestsellers for multiple years
3. Authors who wrote multiple bestseller titles
4. The price of bestsellers
5. Can we predict fiction or non-fiction based on book names themselves?
