For this project, we are analyzing data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank.

We will investigate and plot graphs on different features using Matplotlib:

1. GDP of different countries over the years
2. Life expectancy at birth of different countries over the years
3. Try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries
