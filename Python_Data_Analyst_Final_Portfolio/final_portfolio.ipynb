However, interesting insights about `education` and `age` along with `age_group` have still been noted. These insights would be very helpful to how this store markets deals to their customers and prices items, such as wine since higher income groups tend to dominate alcohol sales. There is also opportunity to increase market to the `18 to 35` and `71 and Older` age groups to drive products sales. \n",
